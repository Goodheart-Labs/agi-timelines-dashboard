# Data Source Requirements
Primary data sources (in order of priority):
1. Polymarket prediction markets
2. Metaculus predictions
3. Sentinel (manual data input)
4. Manifold (backup if unable to get Polymarket or Metaculus)
5. CDC data (under consideration)

# Implementation Notes
- Main graph will show weighted combination of all available sources
- Secondary graphs will show individual data sources
- Need to handle different time periods and data overlaps
- Consider ignoring data before overlap periods if overlap is substantial
- Otherwise, use reduced number of sources for earlier periods

# Database Requirements
- Store historical data points
- Track daily/hourly values from each source
- Store metadata about sources
- Manage weights for combining sources
- Handle missing data and different time periods

# Development Plan
1. Implement data fetchers for each source
2. Set up database structure
3. Create data combination logic
4. Update visualization components
