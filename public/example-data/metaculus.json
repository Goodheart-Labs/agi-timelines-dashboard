    "description": "As of December 11, 2024, CDC [reported](https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html) 58 human cases in the US for 2024 year-to-date. The page presents exposure sources for the cases, attributing 35 to cattle, 21 to poultry, and two to unknown causes. CDC [describes](https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/php/avian-flu-summary/reported-human-infections.html) H5N1 infections in humans as follows:\n\n> HPAI A(H5N1) virus infections have been reported in more than 925 people with approximately 50% case fatality proportion since 1997, including 20 cases and 7 deaths in Hong Kong during 1997-2003, and more than 900 cases reported in 24 countries since November 2003. Mild upper respiratory tract symptoms, lower respiratory tract disease, severe pneumonia with respiratory failure, encephalitis, and multi-organ failure have been reported. The spectrum of illness caused by human infection with current H5N1 bird flu viruses is unknown. Since 2016, a small number of sporadic infections have been reported each year globally. Illness in humans from all bird flu virus infections has ranged in severity from no symptoms or mild illness to severe disease that resulted in death. [Total case counts](https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/php/avian-flu-summary/chart-epi-curve-ah5n1.html) reported since 1997 are available.\n\nThe spread of H5 avian influenza among birds and cattle and its spread to humans has [raised concerns](https://www.today.com/health/disease/bird-flu-pandemic-rcna183174) that it could turn into another pandemic. However, as of December 11, 2024, CDC's [summary of the current situation](https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html) states the following:\n\n> * Person-to-person spread: None\n> * Current public health risk: Low\n\nHistorically during outbreaks, CDC has used a case classification system to identify cases as confirmed, probable, or suspected. For example, see the [case classifications used for the mpox outbreak](https://www.cdc.gov/mpox/hcp/case-definitions/index.html). Speaking generally, a confirmed case is one which is confirmed via laboratory testing, a probable case is one without reason to believe the symptoms may be caused by another disease coupled with some detected biological evidence, and a suspected case is one that exhibits comparable symptoms or has high clinical suspicion of being the disease in question.\n\nA genetic analysis of H5N1 published December 5, 2024 [found](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adt0180) that a single mutation is all that is required for the virus to switch its [binding specificity](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5605752/) from avian to human:\n\n> A single glutamine to leucine mutation at residue 226 of the virus hemagglutinin was sufficient to enact the change from avian to human specificity. In nature, the occurrence of this single mutation could be an indicator of human pandemic risk.\n\nSee also ScienceDaily: [Scientists identify mutation that could facilitate H5N1 'bird flu' virus infection and potential transmission in humans](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/12/241205142418.htm)",

If information is provided such that suspected cases are included in the count, the suspected cases will be excluded if possible, or the question may be resolved as ambiguous if suspected cases cannot be excluded and there are no other alternate case counts available.\n* In the event CDC uses an alternate classification to confirmed, probable, and suspected, Metaculus may clarify the question or make a determination as to which classification of cases count. Metaculus will use the [criteria published for Mpox](https://www.cdc.gov/mpox/hcp/case-definitions/index.html) as guidance in making a determination.\n* This question refers to case counts published before January 1, 2026.

  "description": "As of December 11, 2024, CDC [reported](https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html) 58 human cases in the US for 2024 year-to-date. The page presents exposure sources for the cases, attributing 35 to cattle, 21 to poultry, and two to unknown causes. CDC [describes](https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/php/avian-flu-summary/reported-human-infections.html) H5N1 infections in humans as follows:\n\n> HPAI A(H5N1) virus infections have been reported in more than 925 people with approximately 50% case fatality proportion since 1997, including 20 cases and 7 deaths in Hong Kong during 1997-2003, and more than 900 cases reported in 24 countries since November 2003. Mild upper respiratory tract symptoms, lower respiratory tract disease, severe pneumonia with respiratory failure, encephalitis, and multi-organ failure have been reported. The spectrum of illness caused by human infection with current H5N1 bird flu viruses is unknown. Since 2016, a small number of sporadic infections have been reported each year globally. Illness in humans from all bird flu virus infections has ranged in severity from no symptoms or mild illness to severe disease that resulted in death. [Total case counts](https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/php/avian-flu-summary/chart-epi-curve-ah5n1.html) reported since 1997 are available.\n\nThe spread of H5 avian influenza among birds and cattle and its spread to humans has [raised concerns](https://www.today.com/health/disease/bird-flu-pandemic-rcna183174) that it could turn into another pandemic. However, as of December 11, 2024, CDC's [summary of the current situation](https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html) states the following:\n\n> * Person-to-person spread: None\n> * Current public health risk: Low\n\nHistorically during outbreaks, CDC has used a case classification system to identify cases as confirmed, probable, or suspected. For example, see the [case classifications used for the mpox outbreak](https://www.cdc.gov/mpox/hcp/case-definitions/index.html). Speaking generally, a confirmed case is one which is confirmed via laboratory testing, a probable case is one without reason to believe the symptoms may be caused by another disease coupled with some detected biological evidence, and a suspected case is one that exhibits comparable symptoms or has high clinical suspicion of being the disease in question.\n\nA genetic analysis of H5N1 published December 5, 2024 [found](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adt0180) that a single mutation is all that is required for the virus to switch its [binding specificity](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5605752/) from avian to human:\n\n> A single glutamine to leucine mutation at residue 226 of the virus hemagglutinin was sufficient to enact the change from avian to human specificity. In nature, the occurrence of this single mutation could be an indicator of human pandemic risk.\n\nSee also ScienceDaily: [Scientists identify mutation that could facilitate H5N1 'bird flu' virus infection and potential transmission in humans](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2024/12/241205142418.htm)"
